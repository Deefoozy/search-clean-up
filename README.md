# search-clean-up
Browser extension to remove search results from certain websites

Tested on:
- MS Edge 78.0.276.2 (Chromium), should also work on other Chromium based browsers
- Firefox 68.0.2 

Currently the only way to use the extension is by downloading the source and use it as a developer.
## Firefox
 - ZIP the contents of the repo
 - Navigate to ``about:debugging#addons``
 - Load temporary addon
 - Select the .zip file

## MS Edge
- Navigate to ``edge://extensions/``
- Enable _developer mode_ (bottom left corner)
- Load unpacked
- Select the folder of the cloned repo

## Chromium based browsers
Not tested yet, using the explanation of installing on MS Edge might help you in the right direction
